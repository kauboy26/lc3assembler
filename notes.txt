if the labels have the same name as an instruction, then
this thing might fail. Should I do something about it in the
lex step (i.e. when regexes are being matched)?


THE NEW LINE BUG!!!
in the lex grammar file, you need to say:
\n 				{ rule }
and not
'\n' 			{ rule }
This bug took a while to find.
